About
-----

_jQuery-i18n_ is a jQuery plugin for doing client-side translations in javascript. It is based heavily on [javascript i18n that almost doesn’t suck](http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=100) by Marko Samastur, and is licensed under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

Installation
------------

You'll need to download the [jQuery library](http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#Current_Release), and include it before _jquery.i18n.js_ in your HTML source. See the _examples_ folder for examples.

Usage
-----

Before you can do any translation you have to initialise the plugin with a ‘dictionary’ (basically a property list mapping keys to their translations).

```javascript
var my_dictionary = { 
    'some text':      'a translation',
    'some more text': 'another translation'
}
$.i18n.setDictionary(my_dictionary);
```

Once you’ve initialised it with a dictionary, you can translate strings using the $.i18n._() function, for example:

```javascript
$('div#example').text($.i18n._('some text'));
```

or using $('selector')._t() function

```javascript
$('div#example')._t('some text');
```

Wildcards
---------

It's straightforward to pass dynamic data into your translations. First, add _%s_ in the translation for each variable you want to swap in :

```javascript
var my_dictionary = { 
    "wildcard example"  : "We have been passed two values : %s and %s."
}
$.i18n.setDictionary(my_dictionary);
```

Next, pass an array of values in as the second argument when you perform the translation :

```javascript
$('div#example').text($.i18n._('wildcard example', [100, 200]));
```

or

```javascript
$('div#example')._t('wildcard example', [100, 200]);
```

This will output _We have been passed two values : 100 and 200._

Because some languages depend on other word orderings than e.g. english, you can also specify which variable should appear in which order.

*Example:*

```javascript
var my_dictionary = { 
    "wildcard example"  : "We have been passed two values : %2$s and %1$s."
}
$.i18n.setDictionary(my_dictionary);

$('div#example').text($.i18n._('wildcard example', [100, 200]));
```

This will output: _We have been passed two values: 200 and 100._


Building From Scratch
---------------------

You can build the regular, un-minified version simply by running _ant_:

```bash
$ ant
Buildfile: build.xml

jquery.i18n:
     [echo] Building ./jquery.i18n.js
     [echo] ./jquery.i18n.js built.

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 0 seconds
```

Before you can build the minified version yourself, you'll need to download the [Google Closure Compiler](http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip) and put it in a folder called _build_:

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ wget http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip
$ unzip compiler-latest.zip
```

Once you have the compiler, you can build the minified version by running _ant min_:

```bash
$ ant min
Buildfile: build.xml

jquery.i18n:
     [echo] Building ./jquery.i18n.js
     [echo] ./jquery.i18n.js built.

min:
     [echo] Building ./jquery.i18n.min.js
    [apply] Applied java to 1 file and 0 directories.
   [delete] Deleting: /Users/dave/Documents/Code/jquery/jquery-i18n/tmpmin
     [echo] ./jquery.i18n.min.js built.

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 1 second
```
